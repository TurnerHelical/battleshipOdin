Player.js is the link from index to the rest of the program

each player has their own gameboard and each player tracks hits and misses for themselves

the gameboard tracks ship location and reports the hits or miss to the player classes to record them

if player tries to select same spot as previous, throw error and allow them to pick again

ships.js tracks the individual ships and if they've been hit or sunk and reports to the player how many ships have been sunk and how many are remaining

when a player hits a ship report to ship.js for that individual ship and record the hit in the player class, check if it was sunk and if so check if it was the last ship remaining

if last ship report that the other player won, create an option for the players to restart the game

create a computer player and make the logic for it

write the logic to let the players select their ship locations and record it for each ship
